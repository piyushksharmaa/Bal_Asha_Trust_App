                Mrs. Vira Jamshedji, her husband Late Mr. Jehangir Jamshedji and Ms. Shirin Barucha had a great & fervent vision – to be able to support abandoned, destitute children, battling difficult circumstances in Mumbai. It was from this noble desire that Bal Asha – Children’s Hope, was founded in 1985 and registered as a charitable trust. The organization’s mission was to provide abandoned children with a safe home and support any child in need with care.

                Upon its conception, the first step was to start a clinic in Mazgaon, Mumbai. The clinic was a place where children from all communities could come for medical support and assistance. The trust started its children’s home programme in the year 1987 in King George V Memorial.

                Late Mrs. Madhavi Karandikar joined the organization in the year 1989. A student of social work, she transformed Bal Asha from a child institute to an important stakeholder in the sector of child welfare in the country.

                Today, Bal Asha Trust adheres to principles such as ethics, trust, integrity, and compassion for children incorporated in the management style of the organization by both Veera and Madhavi.
